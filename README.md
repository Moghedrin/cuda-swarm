# Overview
> An implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization Local Search Algorithm implemented upon the GPU (to utilize massive parallelism) using NVIDIA's CUDA Architecture.

#### CORE
* Cuda PSO system
	* (Optimizing Neural Networks)
* Graphics to optionally visualize particles moving around search space

#### HOPE
* Option to run system on GPU or cluster.
* gnuplot generate comparitive graphs.
* GTK gui to work with all the options.

#### DREAM
* Have Go program run as a wrapper, distributing source code and compiling it.
* Enter SC2 unit to Neural Network and see if it can predict unit battle outcome.
